# RAG-Stat: Enhancing Statistical Reasoning in Large Language Models

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **RAG-Stat**, a project aimed at improving statistical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques. The model leverages **LLaMA 2** as the base language model, enhanced by a dynamic retrieval mechanism to improve its ability to handle statistical problems.

## Research Problem

LLMs like LLaMA 2 excel at general language tasks but struggle with specialized domains such as statistics. This project tackles the challenge of improving LLM performance in statistical reasoning, where precision and structured problem-solving are critical. The solution proposed is the application of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach to dynamically retrieve relevant information from statistical datasets and improve the model’s reasoning capabilities.

## Model Architecture

The project focuses on the **LLaMA 2** model (7B parameters) integrated with RAG. Key components of the architecture:
- **Retriever**: A model that fetches relevant information from external datasets (statistical textbooks, research papers) using dense vector embeddings.
- **Generator**: A fine-tuned LLaMA 2 model that generates responses to statistical queries using the retrieved context.
- **Training**: The model is fine-tuned on selected datasets, optimizing performance on specific statistical tasks.

## Key Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines the generative capabilities of LLaMA 2 with external knowledge retrieval to improve the model’s accuracy in handling statistical tasks.
- **Fine-tuning**: Tailored training to optimize LLaMA 2 for answering complex statistical queries, such as expectation, variance, and hypothesis testing.
- **Efficient Knowledge Retrieval**: Implements dense retrieval mechanisms to fetch relevant documents in response to statistical questions, enhancing the model's response accuracy.

## Installation & Usage

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers
- SentenceTransformers

To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RAG-Stat.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd RAG-Stat
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook RAG_STAT.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to fine-tune the model and run statistical reasoning tasks.

## Example Usage

The notebook demonstrates various examples of statistical queries handled by the model. For instance:

```python
# Load the index and create a query engine
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()

# Input a statistical or mathematical question
question = "How many diagonals can you draw in a decagon?"

# Query the model and retrieve a response
response = query_engine.query(question)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

## Results

The model was evaluated on a dataset of statistical questions and compared against baseline models (GPT-2, LLaMA). The results show significant improvements in accuracy and reasoning abilities due to the RAG architecture.

## Future Work

This project sets the foundation for using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models in specialized fields. Key areas for future research include:

- **Integration with More Advanced Models:** Incorporating cutting-edge models like GPT-4 or future iterations of LLaMA can significantly enhance statistical reasoning and complex mathematical operations.

- **Refining RAG Approaches:** Developing more sophisticated, context-aware retrieval systems and adaptive techniques will improve the accuracy and efficiency of statistical problem-solving.

- **Real-World Applications:** Applying RAG-Stat in fields such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research will help tackle complex real-world challenges in data analysis and decision-making.
